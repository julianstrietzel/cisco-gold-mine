# Cisco Spaces for Traffic Optimization
Repository for the START Hack 2024 cisco case of the group ctrl+alt+defeat (10)  
**Here we show to Cisco how they are sitting on a gold mine and how to dig all of it to the ground.**  
Let us show you how we can optimize traffic all over main cities by using Cisco Spaces and the data it provides.

First have a look at our [presentation]() to understand our business case.  
Have a look at how we could use the Cisco Spaces API to optimize traffic light flow using reinforcement learning in the [video](), our [notebook](traffic_cisco.ipynb) and at the [implementation](AI%2FREADME.md).

To be successful follow the master plan:
1. Install Cisco Wifi routers all over the city, like they did in [Cologne](https://netcologne-unternehmen.de/hotspotkoeln/).
2. Use Cisco [Spaces](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/solutions/enterprise-networks/dna-spaces/index.html) to collect traffic data.
3. Use the collected traffic data for simulations to optimize what-if analysis, traffic light timing, construction works and re-routing.
